title: Getting help with Couchdbkit

There is a mailing-list for now on "Google
groups":http://groups.google.com/group/couchdbkit where you can follow changes
and ask questions about Couchdbkit. You can also chat with users and
developers on "#couchdbkit irc channel":irc://irc.freenode.net/couchdbkit or
send a ticket on "bitbucket":http://github.com/benoitc/couchdbkit/.

The best way to get help with Couchdbkit is to email me directly at
"benoitc@e-engura.org":mailto:benoitc@apache.org .
